A Letter from our Director

The indigenous Q’eros people of Peru practice unique, earth-centric textile, musical, agricultural, social and spiritual traditions, yet their way of life is threatened. They are striving to sustain their ancient Andean identity in the face of outward migration, large-scale mining, the arrival of a road and globalization.

The Q’eros are subsistence llama and alpaca herders, potato farmers and weavers who live above 14,500 feet in the Andes mountains of Peru. The Q’eros Nation is the “último ayllu inka,” or the last Inkan community. They have long suffered discrimination and marginalization. Because they lack schools, many migrate to cities for a “better life” of urban poverty. Families rarely return to the community. As one Q’eros grandmother said, “Life is hard up here in the clouds.” Food security is low. Child mortality is high. Few government statistics are kept. Q’eros is a microcosm of the plight of native people worldwide. As stated in an op-ed in The New York Times about Peru in 2013, "the rural Andes languish in nearly feudal conditions" and "if [children] attend school, they do so for only a few years and in Spanish — not Quechua or Aymara, the languages spoken at home. [They are] marginalized by nothing so much as geography." Strikingly, "78 percent of Peru’s indigenous children live in poverty."
