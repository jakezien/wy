      <p>Willka Yachay and Q’eros families have formed a cooperative to share their traditional weavings at a just price. Our collaboration celebrates an ancient and beautiful tradition at the heart of Q’eros culture, promotes its perpetuation by younger generations and enhances family and community economic security.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A large coarsely spun and woven blanket of undyed llama hair in two loom panels is used for sleeping, or to sit upon. Like the produce bags, they usually have stripes in several undyed colors, and sometimes have patterns made using narrow stripes in different colors similar to the belts.&rdquo;</p>
