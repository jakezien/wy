  <h1>Schools</h1>
  <p>Willka Yachay has completed several projects to bring the Q&rsquo;eros people the tools it needs to sustain its culture while surviving in the modern world.</p>

  <p>Willka Yachay&rsquo;s team founded and sustains two community-based primary schools and a secondary school in Q&rsquo;eros. The schools teach the children to read and write in Quechua and Spanish and prepare them to interact with the modern world while preserving and nurturing their traditions. They will ultimately serve as community centers for education, nutrition, health care, and economic opportunity.</p>

  <h1>Primary Schools</h1>
  <p>Willka Yachay coordinates all fundraising and programming for two community-based primary schools: Inkari, in the village of Ch&rsquo;allma Chimpana, and Kusi Qoyllur, in Qocha Moqo. Qualified professors are teaching a combined total of forty children. The warm-hearted and creative children are enjoying an innovative education that respects and cultivates their culture.</p>

  <h1>Ethnic High School</h1>
  <p>Willka Yachay&rsquo;s ethnic high school, or Colegio Etnico, was founded in 2012 in the village of Qocha Moqo. The school is the first of its kind in Peru, and perhaps in the world, in that its curriculum is based on and nurtures a rich indigenous cultural heritage, while also teaching language and math skills through scientific, environmental and ethnographic projects. It provides an education that will enable young Q&rsquo;eros to go on to university, which none has ever done, and ultimately direct their community&rsquo;s future.</p>
