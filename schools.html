    <h2>Modern Inkan Education</h2>
    <p>We provide an education that enables young Q&rsquo;eros to direct their community&rsquo;s future. Our schools teach the children to read and write in their native Quechua as well as in Spanish and prepare them to interact with the modern world while fostering their soulful and intelligent culture.</p>
    <p>Our schools are innovative because our students are becoming aware of their Inkan origins and using both traditional wisdom and modern knowledge for empowerment in today&rsquo;s world. They are realizing that they, like their ancestors before them, are capable of achieving greatness by using their own resources and creativity within the context of their indigenous culture and mountain homeland.</p>

    <h2>Ethnic High School and Adult School</h2>
    <p>In 2012, we opened an ethnic high school in the village of Qocha Moqo. The school&rsquo;s community-derived curriculum is the first of its kind in Peru: it both originates in and nurtures a rich indigenous cultural heritage. It teaches language and math through scientific, environmental, and ethnographic projects, all of which improve the lives of its students and their families. Our high school and adult learning center provide an education that will enable young Q&rsquo;eros to go on to university and ultimately direct their community&rsquo;s future.</p>

    <h3>Inkan Mathematics</h3>
    <p>Q&rsquo;ero high school students are researching the Inkan mathematical device, Yupana, which is an ancient calculator, and Khipu, a rope recording device. They have learned these systems and teach them to younger students within Q&rsquo;eros and at schools and universities in Cusco.</p>
