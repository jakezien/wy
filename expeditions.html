  <p>Willka Yachay would love to collaborate with you in meeting the goals of contributing to and learning from the Q&rsquo;eros! Our director, Hannah, will make expedition arrangements, coordinate with Q&rsquo;ero presidents and accompany you on your visit to Q&rsquo;eros. We can help reserve hotels in Cusco, retreats in the Sacred Valley and visits to sacred sites with licensed guides.</p>
