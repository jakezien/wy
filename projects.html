    <h2>Schools</h2>
    <p>Willka Yachay builds and sustains culturally and ecologically based schools high in the Andes. We founded and built the first preschool, primary schools, high school, and adult learning center in the Q&rsquo;eros villages of Ch&rsquo;allmachimpana and Qocha Moqo. Our schools teach the children to read and write in both their native Quechua and in Spanish, and prepare them to interact with the modern world while fostering their soulful and intelligent culture. We provide an education that enables young Q&rsquo;eros to direct their community&rsquo;s future.</p>

    <h2>Alternative Energy</h2>
    <p>The alternative energy projects we support are designed to teach mathematics, physics and engineering and to improve the quality of life in Q&rsquo;eros. Willka Yachay&rsquo;s first successful energy project was a hydro-electric generator hand built and deployed by our high school students and their teacher. The turbine now provides electricity for an entire community building.</p>
    <p>We have supplied and installed six solar panel systems for schools in Q&rsquo;eros. </p>
    <p>Willka Yachay manages a solar light/textile exchange program for Q&rsquo;eros familes, with whom we exchange solar-powered d.lights for small handmade weavings. We sell these weavings and reinvest the returns in our schools and development projects.</p>

    <h2>Traditional and Western Medicine</h2>
    <p>Working with traditional Q&rsquo;eros healers, or curanderos, primary and secondary students are learning about native medicinal plants and their uses.</p>
    <p>Willka Yachay provides emergency health care support, including transportation from Q&rsquo;eros to city hospitals, rehabilitation care and patient/family social services.</p>
    <p>We are establishing a community health center or Hampi Wasi, home of healing, that will combine modern first aid medicine and ancient healing wisdom.</p>

    <h2>Weaving Cooperative</h2>
    <p>Willka Yachay and Q&rsquo;eros mothers and fathers have formed a cooperative to sell their traditional weavings at a just price, locally and abroad. The celebration of this ancient and beautiful tradition at the heart of Q&rsquo;eros culture is promoting its perpetuation by younger generations while enhancing community and family economic security.</p>

    <h2>Food Security</h2>
    <p>Our ethnic high school&rsquo;s first educational/community development project was building a  masonry oven that bakes bread and heats water for Qocha Moqo. Every week our students make Andean grain (quinoa or kiwicha) bread from scratch for the village.</p>
    <p>Willka Yachay and our high school students built the first of several trout ponds that will supplement the local diet of potatoes and alpaca with fresh fish. Our students and their parents also built a greenhouse for raising guinea pigs and other small animals. </p>

    <h2>Cultural Preservation</h2>
    <p>The Q&rsquo;eros people are the wisdom keepers of the Andes. The Q&rsquo;eros Nation has been designated by Peru&rsquo;s Ministry of Culture a &ldquo;national living cultural patrimony&rdquo; for the continuity of its ancient Andean traditions. Considered to be the &ldquo;&uacute;ltimo ayllu inka,&rdquo; or the last Inkan community of Peru, the Q&rsquo;eros strive to preserve and promote their indigenous ethnic and cultural identity.</p>
    <p>That wisdom is expressed in their daily lives through their ancient customs including weaving, farming, music, plant medicine and spirituality. Moms, dads and elders teach all of these and more in our schools.</p>
