        <p>Willka Yachay builds and sustains a culturally and ecologically based school system high in the Andes. We founded and built the first preschool, primary schools, high school and adult learning center in the Q’eros villages of Ch’allmachimpana and Qocha Moqo.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <p>Our schools teach the children to read and write in both their native Quechua and in Spanish, and prepare them to interact with the modern world while fostering their soulful and intelligent culture. We provide an education that enables young Q’eros to direct their community’s future.</p>

      <div class="col">
        <p>The alternative energy projects we support are designed to teach mathematics, physics and engineering and to improve the quality of life in Q&rsquo;eros. Willka Yachay&rsquo;s first successful energy project was a hydroelectric generator hand built and deployed by our high school students and their teacher. The turbine now provides electricity for an entire community building.</p>

      <div class="col">
        <p>We are supplying and installing solar panels for schools in Q&rsquo;eros.</p>
        <p>Willka Yachay manages a solar light/textile exchange program for Q&rsquo;eros families. We trade solar-powered d.lights for small handmade weavings. We sell these weavings and reinvest the returns in our schools and development projects.</p>

        <p>Our ethnic high school&rsquo;s first educational community development project was building a masonry oven that bakes bread and heats water for Qocha Moqo. Every week our students make Andean grain (quinoa or kiwicha) bread from scratch for the village.</p>

      <div class="col">
        <p>Willka Yachay and our high school students built the first of several trout ponds that will supplement the local diet of potatoes and alpaca with fresh fish. Our students and their parents also built a greenhouse for raising guinea pigs and other small animals. </p>

        <p>The Q&rsquo;eros people are the wisdom keepers of the Andes. The Q&rsquo;eros Nation has been designated by Peru&rsquo;s Ministry of Culture a &ldquo;national living cultural patrimony&rdquo; for the continuity of its ancient Andean traditions. Considered to be the <i>&uacute;ltimo ayllu inka,</i> or the last Inkan community of Peru, the Q&rsquo;eros strive to preserve and promote their indigenous ethnic and cultural identity.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <p>This wisdom is expressed in their daily lives through their ancient customs of weaving, farming, music, plant medicine and spirituality. Moms, dads and elders teach all of these and more in our schools.</p>
