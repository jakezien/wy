<section id="energy">
  <div class="text">
    <h2>Alternative Energy</h2>
    <p>The alternative energy projects we support are designed to teach mathematics, physics and engineering, and improve the quality of life in Q&rsquo;eros.</p>
    <p>Willka Yachay&rsquo;s first successful energy project was a hydro-electric generator hand built and deployed by our high school students and their teacher. The turbine now provides electricity for several classrooms.</p>
    <p>We have supplied and installed one solar panel system and will implement more in the future with an eye toward bringing electricity to all of Q&rsquo;eros.</p>

<section id="food">
  <div class="text">
    <h2>Food Security</h2>
    <p>The ethnic high school’s first learning project was building a masonry oven that bakes bread and heats water for Qocha Moqo. Willka Yachay’s vision is to support other villages in doing the same.</p>
    <p>Willka Yachay and community members are planning to build a trout pond and more greenhouses in 2013 to supplement the local diet of potatoes and alpaca with fresh fish and vegetables.</p>
