The sides are then folded diagonally and the remaining corners are tied together to carry. Q’ero women will use either fur bags or small carrying cloths for holding coca. Medium-sized cloths are used to carry cold lunch to the fields. These square cloths are woven predominantly of undyed yarn, and consist of a single loom panel. Occasionally a quartered design is woven in the cloth through the use of a dovetailed-warp join through the center. This technique is called t’iklli in Q’ero and is mastered by relatively few weavers. Lastly, the largest carrying cloths are referred to as kana. They are woven out of llama hair and used to carry larger loads, like a baby!'
