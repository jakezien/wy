Medium-sized cloths are used to carry cold lunch to the fields. These square cloths are woven predominantly of undyed yarn, and consist of a single loom panel.

This technique is called t’iklli in Q’ero and is mastered by relatively few weavers. Lastly, the largest carrying cloths are referred to as kana. They are woven out of llama hair and used to carry larger loads, like a baby!'
